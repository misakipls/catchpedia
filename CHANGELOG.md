### Local Development (.env.local)
Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with:
```
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-strong-password-here
```

**Important:** Replace `your-strong-password-here` with a strong, unique password.

### Production Deployment

#### Vercel
1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings → Environment Variables
3. Add new variable:
   - **Name:** `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
   - **Value:** Your strong password
   - **Environment:** Production (and Preview if desired)

#### Netlify
1. Go to your Netlify site dashboard
2. Navigate to Site settings → Environment variables
3. Add new variable:
   - **Key:** `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
   - **Value:** Your strong password

## Security Features

### Cookie Security
- **HttpOnly:** Prevents client-side JavaScript access
- **SameSite=Lax:** CSRF protection
- **Secure:** Set to `true` in production (automatically detected)
- **Max-Age:** 24 hours (86400 seconds)
- **Path:** Root path for site-wide access

### Server-Side Protection
- All admin routes protected with server-side authentication checks
- Automatic redirects to login page for unauthorized access
- No admin password exposed in client-side JavaScript bundles

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Access Admin Login
- Visit `/admin` in your browser
- You should see a login form with password input

### 2. Test Wrong Password
- Enter an incorrect password
- Should see "Invalid password" error message
- Should remain on login page

### 3. Test Correct Password
- Enter the correct password from your `.env.local`
- Should redirect to `/admin/dashboard`
- Should see admin dashboard with "Manage Articles" button

### 4. Test Protected Routes
- Try accessing `/admin/manage` directly without logging in
- Should redirect to `/admin` login page
- After login, should be able to access all admin routes

### 5. Test Logout
- Click "Logout" button on dashboard
- Should clear admin cookie and redirect to home page
- Try accessing `/admin/dashboard` again - should redirect to login

### 6. Test Article Management
- From dashboard, click "Manage Articles"
- Should see article management interface
- Test creating, editing, and deleting articles

## Security Recommendations

### Production Security
1. **Use HTTPS:** Ensure your production site uses HTTPS
2. **Strong Passwords:** Use a long, random password (20+ characters)
3. **Password Rotation:** Regularly rotate the admin password
4. **Environment Variables:** Use platform secrets management for production
5. **Cookie Security:** The system automatically sets `Secure=true` in production

### Additional Security Measures
- Consider implementing rate limiting for login attempts
- Monitor admin access logs
- Use a password manager to generate and store the admin password
- Consider implementing 2FA for additional security

## Route Structure

### Public Routes (No Authentication Required)
- `/` - Homepage
- `/search` - Search functionality
- `/fish`, `/locations`, `/waters`, etc. - Category pages
- `/fish/[slug]`, `/locations/[slug]`, etc. - Article pages
- `/fish/subcategory/[slug]`, etc. - Subcategory pages

### Protected Routes (Authentication Required)
- `/admin` - Login page
- `/admin/dashboard` - Admin dashboard
- `/admin/manage` - Article management
- `/admin/edit/[id]` - Article editing

### API Routes
- `POST /api/admin-login` - Authentication endpoint
- `POST /api/admin-logout` - Logout endpoint

## Notes
- The old `/edit/[id]` route still exists but is not linked from the admin interface
- All admin functionality is now properly protected
- No public links to admin areas exist in the site navigation
- The system maintains the existing localStorage-based article storage
